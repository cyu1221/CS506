Economic Recessionsâ€™ Effect on Educational Activity

The goal of our project is to find out how economic recessions affect educational activity. To determine this, we will to look at how schools respond to economic recessions as well as how students (or prospective students) respond to economic recessions. To give a more insightful analysis of this, we also have to look at how state and federal government educational spendings change in response to economic recessions.  Specifically, in part due to the availability of data, we will be analyzing the 2008 recession, with the goal of answering the following questions: How do schools respond to economic recessions? Which schools respond similarly in economic recessions? How do students respond to recessions?
